1. **Buy On Day One - Parts and Mods for Bdub's Vehicles 2.0 (with the Mechanic Trader)** lets you buy all vehicle parts and vehicle mods from the Bdub's Vehicles 2.0 mod starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse.

2. All vanilla traders carry **bicycle**, **minibike** and **golf cart** parts.

3. The **Mechanic Trader** has the parts for all vehicles from Bdub's Vehicles and all the vehicle mods (both vanilla and from Bdub's Vehicles). 

4. If your world doesn't have the Mechanic Trader, use this mod instead: [Buy On Day One - Parts and Mods for Bdub's Vehicles 2.0 (No Mechanic Trader)](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8566).

5. Traders will not carry complete vehicles. If you want to buy complete vehicles, use this mod instead: [Buy On Day One - Vehicles and Mods for Bdub's Vehicles](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8565).

6. This mod will switch off if [**Buy On Day One - Vehicles and Mods for Bdub's Vehicles**](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8565) is loaded. 

# Important Notes 

1. If you install any of the [Buy On Day One mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/flatlanderone/mods) in an existing world, you must reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.

2. Not tested in multiplayer.

3. The mods should not affect other vehicle mods (to be confirmed).

4. Removing the mods is probably safe, but you should always make a backup of your game save and reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.

5. Do not install alongside **Buy On Day One - Parts and Mods for Bdub's Vehicles 2.0 (No Mechanic Trader)**.
