# Pick Up Some Of The Common Things - version 2.5.1.0

# Overview
**Pick Up Some Of The Common Things** lets you pick up, scrap and place many of the common things that a sensible survivor would find reasonable to carry in his semi-magical postapocalyptic backpack. Traffic cones and sawhorses are reasonable. Refigerators are not.

# Requirements
 - 7 Days to Die v2.5 and later.

# Manual installation
 1. Download the mod file.
 2. Decompress it anywhere on your hard drive.
 3. Copy the **PickUpSomeOfTheCommonThings** folder to the 7 Days to Die Mods folder. The default location is **%APPDATA%\7DaysToDie\Mods**.

# Important notes
 1. Removing the mod is probably safe, but you should always make a backup of your game save.
