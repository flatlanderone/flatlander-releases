# About Rambling Man - Archery on the Road

**Rambling Man - Archery on the Road** adds several new early- and mid-game options for archery builds. 

The main objective of the mod is to allow players to use steel, exploding and flaming arrows and bolts in significant quantities before acquiring a crucible and the ability to produce steel arrowheads. The mod also adds a bleed effect to bows and crossbows. Finally, the mod introduces modified versions of common thrown explosives.

# Features

## Improvised steel, exploding and flaming arrows and bolts 
- Improvised versions of steel, flaming and exploding arrows and bolts can be crafted without a workbench, but they require more resources.
- Improvised exploding arrows/bolts deal between -30% and +30% damage in comparison with regular exploding arrows/bolts. They require iron arrows/bolts and **Improvised Pipe Bombs** (new recipe).
- Improvised steel arrows and bolts are slightly less effective against armor and fly slower.
- Improvised arrows and bolts are indicated by the Pack Mule symbol in the bottom left of the item icon.

## Bleed (new effect), maintenance, and boxes of arrows/bolts
- With the new *The Ranger's Guide to Archery Vol 6*, bows and crossbows have a 35% chance to inflict stacking bleeding damage.
- Reading all the books in the Ranger's Guide to Archery series unlocks the slower degradation of bows and crossbows. It also unlocks the crafting of space-saving boxes of regular arrows and bolts. Note that improvised arrows and bolts do not lend themselves to tighter packing.

## More arrowheads
- Scrapping arrows and bolts produces iron and steel arrowheads instead of scrap iron.
- Each Archery perk rank lets players find more arrowheads in loot.
- Traders carry more arrowheads.

## Improvised thrown explosives
- The mod reuses Improvised thrown explosives from the **Rambling Man - Improvised Explosives and Arrows** mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8456](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8456).
- Improvised versions of the following thrown explosives can be crafted without a workbench:
  - pipe bombs,
  - dynamite,
  - timed charges.
- They require more resources to craft and tend to work more randomly than the regular versions crafted in the workbench.
- **Improvised Pipe Bombs** are required to craft improvised exploding arrows and bolts.
- Improvised explosives are indicated by the Pack Mule symbol in the bottom left of the item icon.
