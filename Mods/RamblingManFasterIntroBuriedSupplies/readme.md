# Overview

1. **Faster Intro Buried Supplies** lets you start and complete the Intro Buried Supplies quest before visiting the Trader. When you visit the Trader, you will receive the pipe weapon bundle and you can start doing regular quests immediately.

2. After completing the ***Basics of Survival*** challenges, you receive the new ***Dig up the supplies and find the Trader*** quest and are directed to the buried supplies. Once you have dug them up, you are directed to the closest Trader in the current biome.

3. If you fail the quest while digging up the supplies (exit the game, die before retrieving the supplies or leave the quest area), you can restart the quest by reading the special ***Quest - Dig up the supplies and find the Trader*** map. This map is removed from your inventory after you successfully retrieve the supplies from their container.

4. **Faster Intro Buried Supplies** relies on custom features provided by [0-Score by sphereii](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/6176). You must install 0-Score to use this mod.
