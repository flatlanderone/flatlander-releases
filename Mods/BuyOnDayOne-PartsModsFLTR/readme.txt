# Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods

Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods lets you buy all vanilla vehicle parts and vehicle mods starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse. All traders carry bicycle and minibike parts, Trader Bob has also all the parts for the Motorcycle, the 4x4 Truck, and the Gyrocopter and all the vehicle mods. Traders will NOT carry complete vehicles (to be confirmed).

# Important Notes 
1. If you install any of the Buy On Day One mods in an existing world, you must reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
2. Not tested in multiplayer.
3. Removing the mod is probably safe, but you probably should reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.

# Requirements
