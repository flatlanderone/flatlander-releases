# Buy On Day One - Vanilla Vehicles and Mods 2.5.1.0

## Overview
Buy On Day One - Vanilla Vehicles and Mods lets you buy all vanilla vehicles and vehicle mods starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse. All traders carry the Bicycle and the Minibike as well as the new storage mod. Trader Bob also has the Motorcycle, the 4x4 Truck, and the Gyrocopter and all the vehicle mods.

## Important Notes 
1. If you install any of the Buy On Day One mods in an existing world, you must reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
2. Not tested in multiplayer.
3. Removing the mod is probably safe, but you probably should reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
